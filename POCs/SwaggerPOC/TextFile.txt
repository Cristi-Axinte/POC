Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. 
The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger. 
Why is it so great? Well, by reading your API’s structure, we can automatically build beautiful and interactive API documentation.
